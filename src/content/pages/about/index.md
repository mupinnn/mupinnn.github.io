I'm enjoying front-end development. I love to code, learn something new, eat, sleep and poop, yeah, take a shit give me unlimited ideas to thinking about, lol.

I was born in mid 2001. My very first code when I was junior high school trying to make an rpg game with Unity3D from YouTube tutorial with my potato PC without knowing what programming it is. At that time, I was really like playing games and from that came up with wild thoughts about making games and make me have a life goals to be a 'Game Developer'.

Long story short, in the end of junior high school, I decided to continue my study to vocational high school in majors software engineering, and from that, I realized that to be a Game Dev is hard with a complex learning curve. Time goes by, lesson after lesson I passed, I found myself comfortable with something that eye-catching and beautiful to see, YEAH! I like cool, anti-mainstream, flat design interfaces. So, I find a way to learn Front-End Development from HTMl/CSS/JavaScript basic fundamental. Until now, I'm still learning something new, whether it's a tools, framework, methodology, whatever it is. If it's useful and I need it, I'll try to learn that thing.
