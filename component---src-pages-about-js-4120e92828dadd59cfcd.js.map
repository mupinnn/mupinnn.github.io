I love to code, learn\n                something new, eat, sleep and poop, yeah, take a shit give me\n                unlimited ideas to thinking about, lol.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"mb-3 text-sm md:text-base\">\n                I was born in mid 2001. My very first code when I was junior\n                high school trying to make an rpg game with Unity3D from YouTube\n                tutorial with my potato PC without knowing what programming it\n                is. At that time, I was really like playing games and from that\n                came up with wild thoughts about making games and make me have a\n                life goals to be a 'Game Developer'.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"mb-5 text-sm md:text-base\">\n                Long story short, in the end of junior high school, I decided to\n                continue my study to vocational high school in majors software\n                engineering, and from that, I realized that to be a Game Dev is\n                hard with a complex learning curve. Time goes by, lesson after\n                lesson I passed, I found myself comfortable with something that\n                eye-catching and beautiful to see, YEAH! I like cool,\n                anti-mainstream, flat design interfaces. So, I find a way to\n                learn Front-End Development from HTMl/CSS/JavaScript basic\n                fundamental. Until now, I'm still learning something new,\n                whether it's a tools, framework, methodology, whatever it is. If\n                it's useful and I need it, I'll try to learn that thing.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"mb-3 text-sm font-bold\">\n                \"Do what you understand, and understand what you do.\"\n            </p>\n        </Layout>\n    );\n}\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
