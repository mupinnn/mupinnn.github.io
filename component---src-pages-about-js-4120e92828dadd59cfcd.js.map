My very first code when I was junior high school\n        trying to make an rpg game with Unity3D from YouTube tutorial with my\n        potato PC without knowing what programming it is. At that time, I was\n        really like playing games and from that came up with wild thoughts about\n        making games and make me have a life goals to be a 'Game Developer'.\n      </p>\n      <p className=\"mb-5 text-sm md:text-base\">\n        Long story short, in the end of junior high school, I decided to\n        continue my study to vocational high school in majors software\n        engineering, and from that, I realized that to be a Game Dev is hard\n        with a complex learning curve. Time goes by, lesson after lesson I\n        passed, I found myself comfortable with something that eye-catching and\n        beautiful to see, YEAH! I like cool, anti-mainstream, flat design\n        interfaces. So, I find a way to learn Front-End Development from\n        HTMl/CSS/JavaScript basic fundamental. Until now, I'm still learning\n        something new, whether it's a tools, framework, methodology, whatever it\n        is. If it's useful and I need it, I'll try to learn that thing.\n      </p>\n      <p className=\"mb-3 text-sm font-bold\">\n        \"Do what you understand, and understand what you do.\"\n      </p>\n    </Layout>\n  );\n}\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
